## Other Emergency Services 

```{r OES}
forecast_chart(call_forecasts, "other emergency services")
```


No noticeable differnce between actual calls and forecast 


## Police Generated

```{r Police Generated}
forecast_chart(call_forecasts, "police generated")
```

No noticeable difference between actual cals and forecast (after, manually setting the lower CI of the forecasts to be zero if it is less than zero in the original forecast))




## Public Non-Emergency 

```{r Public Non-Emergency}
forecast_chart(call_forecasts, "public non-emergency")
```

No noticeable difference between actual cals and forecast


## ANPR

```{r ANPR}
forecast_chart(call_forecasts, "ANPR")
```

No noticeable difference between actual calls and forecast - ?



## 999

```{r 999}
forecast_chart(call_forecasts, "999")
```








Calls to 999 received pre-pandemic are higher than those actual actual received during the pandemic. This would be expected with reduced opportunities to commit crimes and therefore less crimes to report. However, there is no clear noticeable trend in the changes as unsure if these changes would be expected?

# Changes in call types

# Expressions of concern


![](index_files/figure-html/asbplot-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Expressions of concern

&gt; "ASB calls [are] about COVID breaches being coded as ASB … lots of people were reporting other people for breaching the rules. There were a lot of calls where people were very frustrated and they were complaining about their neighbours and the sort of call that sticks in my mind, which I found quite moving quite upsetting really was when somebody would ring in and say that they weren't able to go and visit their elderly relative who lived maybe a mile away … and their next door neighbour was having a party and all these people were turning up." (interview 1)

---

# Expressions of concern

&gt; "… at the start of it, nobody really knew how it was going to affect them. I think there were a lot of people were quite genuinely scared that they were gonna maybe die from it." (interview 3)

---

# Expressions of concern

&gt; "We do get quite a lot of calls, sometimes about oh, you know the the neighbors are smoking drugs in the back garden, you know, sort of weed, that kind of thing." (interview 8)

---

## Advice/Directions/Admin

![](index_files/figure-html/Admin-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Calls for information/reassurance

&gt; "… in the first part of the first lockdown, people were very confused and very worried about breaking the law and very worried about being arrested for and they would ring up and say, can I do this and can I do that so people were actually asking our advice …" (interview 1)

---

# Calls for information/reassurance

&gt; "… there are also people calling in because they wanted advice about regulations or were uncertain about what they were allowed to do things …" (interview 3)

---

# Calls for information/reassurance

&gt; "I'd say there's definitely an increase in mental health related incidents that we're seeing and I think people are just really struggling with the isolation of being away from everyone … Sometimes people don't know [who to call] to speak to someone for support so they just ring the police. " (interview 4)

---

# Support for such calls

&gt; "We were directing people to the government website … We were we're not really qualified to advise people on the regulations that actually fit their particular area, because there was an area to area thing at certain times during the lockdown where different local councils and had different idea about the rules, interpreted the rules differently …" (interview 1)

---

# Support for such calls

&gt; "Getting quite a few calls from elderly people asking for advice … advice on guidelines … Of course we referred them to the government website because they're better off going something like that's got advice in relation to [COVID regulations] (interview 4) 

---

# Support for such calls

&gt; "We have an FAQ. That specially for FCC stuff. And most of the answers can be found in there … There was plenty of support here at work … we had a very large VDU display on the wall with the latest rules and regulations like a like a PowerPoint running through on a continual on a continual rotation." (interview 1) 


---

# Violence and harassment

![](index_files/figure-html/Violence/Harassment-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Night time economy

&gt; "Kickoffs, if if I can say that Saturday nights drunken night, yeah, those sort of thing, those sort of calls were a massive decrease." (interview 5)

---

# Night time economy

&gt; "A lot of the violence incidents that we deal with, especially the likes of Friday night, Saturday night, weekends people have been out drinking and the clubs and pubs and starting fights wasn't happening because the pubs weren't open." (interview 8)

---

# Online harassment

&gt; "There's definitely more online crime. So obviously people are not able to go out and interact in person, but they can over social media and other avenues, such as phone calls, texts - these definitely seem more … I'd say they changed in the sense that the threats were still being made, but not in person, so they will be made over a text or a phone call, social media …" (interview 4)

# Domestic incidents

# Domestic incidents
This does not change when we break down by grade of call.

class: center, middle

# Domestic incidents: no increase

&gt; "We were expecting an increase in domestic violence and domestic violence is a big issue for any force. And I'm not sure that in the early days we saw an increase. Certainly I didn't notice a dramatic increase or anything like that. (interview 3)
 
---

# Domestic incidents: no increase

&gt; "I don't really remember them being any higher in the lock downs than normal, and there were a lot of people were saying that all domestics have gone up, but I'm just guessing that people were spending so much time with each other forced that they're gonna have arguments. " (interview 6)
 
---

# Domestic incidents: no increase

&gt; "I did expect more domestics and things because people were in their addresses, but it didn't. From my personal experience didn't seem to happen." (interview 7)

---

# Domestic incidents: no increase

&gt; "… when we get the calls it's like … when they've been out on the town up to the pubs having drinks and then they come back and they disagree over something so little. And that's when the domestic start." (interview 5)

---

# Domestic incidents: couldn't call?

&gt; "I remember a lady who was desperately upset. She was very, very distressed and this must have been as lockdown was easing a bit because her husband had actually gone out and this was the first opportunity she'd had to make the call … that Lady had more than likely gone through all sorts before she could actually found the opportunity to ring it in." (interview 1)

class: center, middle

# Highlights

- Expressions of concern
- Calls for advice

- No change in domestic violence
- For ASB the caller "profile" changed


---
class: center, middle
# Recommendations

- Further spatio-temporal analysis
- Share good practice (e.g. FHQ information to clarify rules and regulations)
- Further and more robust look at changes to domestic incidents
